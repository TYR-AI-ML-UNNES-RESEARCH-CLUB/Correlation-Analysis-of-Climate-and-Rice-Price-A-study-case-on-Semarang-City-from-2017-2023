# Correlation Analysis of Climate and Rice Price: A study case on Semarang City from 2017-2023
This is made for SEC Satria Data 2024. We already finish the works, but we stuck on administration problem. Even though we can upload it, there's stil a problem. We can't make sure how and why we conduct the research. It's actually our first research and writing is kinda a problem. This reposity only provide a soft file of the paper that should be submitted in competition. If you want access to the code, ask [@Kingki19](https://github.com/Kingki19) because he maintain the documentation and the code. Ask him via email or whatsapp or Instagram chat, he will happy to make a conversation with you.

**The brief summary in English, because the paper is written in Bahasa**:  
Climate change is contribute to many aspect of human life. Also in the same time, the rice's price is also changing drastically. This research is conducted to analyze the correlation between climate aspect that could be correlated to rice price in Semarang between 2017-2023. To limit spatial-temporal aspect, we choose **Semarang** because it's city of our university and the availibilty of dataset. We used 2 dataset, 1) Climate dataset from BMKG (Government Organization that works in Climate and Earthquakes); 2) Rice price dataset from SIHATI (Comodity price monitoring in Central Java). We did clean the data with interpolation to fill missing data. We perform 4 correlation analysis:
1. Pearson correlation analysis to find linear correlation;
2. Spearman correlation to find monotone correlation;
3. Cross-correlation to find lag correlation;
4. Auto-correlation to find correlation for each feature to spatial features.

In summary, we found that somehow climate features has weak correlation to rice price based on Pearson and Spearman correlation. On other result, cross-correlation shown that there's bad movement of each lag for each features, it has unstable and unpredictable wave. Last result on Auto-correlation shown that price rice has periodic but with less frequency with less lag and some climates features shown that have cyclic wave and not. It indicates that we need to understand more and approach another research to reveal more information of correlation between Rice Price and Climates. We, as students, really don't understand what is need to be fix on our paper. If have a suggestion, we would like to know. Thanks for your time reading this yapping.
